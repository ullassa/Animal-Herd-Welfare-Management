# 🌾 Animal Herd Welfare Management System  

A full-stack web app built to help farmers manage animal health and welfare.  
Built using **HTML, CSS, JS**, and planned Django backend.  
Deployed online, recognized and published in local media.  
Built for real-world usage, helping farmers in Sondekere (Hiriyur Taluk) and surrounding regions.

 “I’ve built the frontend part and deployed it live for demonstration. The idea is original and addresses a real problem. I’m planning to integrate backend and database soon, but I prioritized UI/UX first.”
